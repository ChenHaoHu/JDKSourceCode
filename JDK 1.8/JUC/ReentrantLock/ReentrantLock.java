/**
 * A reentrant(可重入的) mutual exclusion （互斥） {@link Lock} with the same basic
 * behavior and semantics （语义）as the implicit（隐性） monitor lock accessed using
 * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
 * capabilities.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ReentrantLock} is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
 * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
 * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
 * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
 * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
 * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
 * #getHoldCount}.
 *
 * <p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 * <em>fairness （公平） </em> parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
 * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
 * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
 * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
 * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
 * variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
 * starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
 * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
 * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
 * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
 * lock.
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock()} method does not
 * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 * is available even if other threads are waiting.
 *
 * <p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
 * follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
 * typically in a before/after construction such as:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
 * class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
 * methods for inspecting （检查） the state of the lock.  Some of these
 * methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
 * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.

         * 2）如果设置失败(即当前的锁数量可能已经为1了，即在尝试的过程中，已经被其他线程先一步占有了锁)，这个时候当前线程执行acquire(1)方法
         * 2.1）acquire(1)方法首先调用下边的tryAcquire(1)方法，在该方法中，首先获取锁数量状态，
         * 2.1.1）如果为0(证明该独占锁已被释放，当下没有线程在使用)，这个时候我们继续使用CAS将state（锁数量）从0设置为1，如果设置成功，当前线程独占锁；-->请求成功-->第二次插队；当然，如果设置不成功，直接返回false
         * 2.2.2）如果不为0，就去判断当前的线程是不是就是当下独占锁的线程，如果是，就将当前的锁数量状态值+1（这也就是可重入锁的名称的来源）-->请求成功
         * 
         * 下边的流程一句话：请求失败后，将当前线程链入队尾并挂起，之后等待被唤醒。
         * 
         * 2.2.3）如果最后在tryAcquire(1)方法中上述的执行都没成功，即请求没有成功，则返回false，继续执行acquireQueued(addWaiter(Node.EXCLUSIVE), arg)方法
         * 2.2）在上述方法中，首先会使用addWaiter(Node.EXCLUSIVE)将当前线程封装进Node节点node，然后将该节点加入等待队列（先快速入队，如果快速入队不成功，其使用正常入队方法无限循环一直到Node节点入队为止）
         * 2.2.1）快速入队：如果同步等待队列存在尾节点，将使用CAS尝试将尾节点设置为node，并将之前的尾节点插入到node之前
         * 2.2.2）正常入队：如果同步等待队列不存在尾节点或者上述CAS尝试不成功的话，就执行正常入队（该方法是一个无限循环的过程，即直到入队为止）-->第一次阻塞
         * 2.2.2.1）如果尾节点为空（初始化同步等待队列），创建一个dummy节点，并将该节点通过CAS尝试设置到头节点上去，设置成功的话，将尾节点也指向该dummy节点（即头节点和尾节点都指向该dummy节点）
         * 2.2.2.1）如果尾节点不为空，执行与快速入队相同的逻辑，即使用CAS尝试将尾节点设置为node，并将之前的尾节点插入到node之前
         * 最后，如果顺利入队的话，就返回入队的节点node，如果不顺利的话，无限循环去执行2.2)下边的流程，直到入队为止
         * 2.3）node节点入队之后，就去执行acquireQueued(final Node node, int arg)（这又是一个无限循环的过程，这里需要注意的是，无限循环等于阻塞，多个线程可以同时无限循环--每个线程都可以执行自己的循环，这样才能使在后边排队的节点不断前进）
         * 2.3.1）获取node的前驱节点p，如果p是头节点，就继续使用tryAcquire(1)方法去尝试请求成功，-->第三次插队（当然，这次插队不一定不会使其获得执行权，请看下边一条），
         * 2.3.1.1）如果第一次请求就成功，不用中断自己的线程，如果是之后的循环中将线程挂起之后又请求成功了，使用selfInterrupt()中断自己
         * （注意p==head&&tryAcquire(1)成功是唯一跳出循环的方法，在这之前会一直阻塞在这里，直到其他线程在执行的过程中，不断的将p的前边的节点减少，直到p成为了head且node请求成功了--即node被唤醒了，才退出循环）
         * 2.3.1.2）如果p不是头节点，或者tryAcquire(1)请求不成功，就去执行shouldParkAfterFailedAcquire(Node pred, Node node)来检测当前节点是不是可以安全的被挂起，
         * 2.3.1.2.1）如果node的前驱节点pred的等待状态是SIGNAL（即可以唤醒下一个节点的线程），则node节点的线程可以安全挂起，执行2.3.1.3）
         * 2.3.1.2.2）如果node的前驱节点pred的等待状态是CANCELLED，则pred的线程被取消了，我们会将pred之前的连续几个被取消的前驱节点从队列中剔除，返回false（即不能挂起），之后继续执行2.3）中上述的代码
         * 2.3.1.2.3）如果node的前驱节点pred的等待状态是除了上述两种的其他状态，则使用CAS尝试将前驱节点的等待状态设为SIGNAL，并返回false（因为CAS可能会失败，这里不管失败与否，都返回false，下一次执行该方法的之后，pred的等待状态就是SIGNAL了），之后继续执行2.3）中上述的代码
         * 2.3.1.3）如果可以安全挂起，就执行parkAndCheckInterrupt()挂起当前线程，之后，继续执行2.3）中之前的代码
         * 最后，直到该节点的前驱节点p之前的所有节点都执行完毕为止，我们的p成为了头节点，并且tryAcquire(1)请求成功，跳出循环，去执行。
         * （在p变为头节点之前的整个过程中，我们发现这个过程是不会被中断的）
         * 2.3.2）当然在2.3.1）中产生了异常，我们就会执行cancelAcquire(Node node)取消node的获取锁的意图。
